# Recycle ATX
### Current Work In Progress! 

The purpose of this project is to help Austin folks quickly find a recycle center to recycle what they need.
Data gathered from [Austin Open Data's Recycle Drop Off Location Dataset](https://data.austintexas.gov/resource/qzi7-nx8g).

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
