# Recycle ATX
### Current Work In Progress! 

The purpose of this project is to help Austin folks quickly find a recycle center to recycle what they need.
Data gathered from [Austin Open Data's Recycle Drop Off Location Dataset](https://data.austintexas.gov/resource/qzi7-nx8g).

### Planned work
- Add "scroll to top" button for scrolling (or make the filter buttons a sticky header).
- Add google maps to each result item. User should be able to launch in native map app if availble.
- Add a page for general recyling tips
- Research other data sets available in Austin Open Data that could be useful in the realm of recycling.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
